    "question": "what is northern light (meaning)",
    "answer": "The Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, are a natural light display in the Arctic sky. They appear when charged particles from the sun collide with gases in Earth’s atmosphere, creating waves of light that move and change shape. They are most often green, but can also appear in purple, pink or red. Lapland is one of the best places in the world to see them.",

A typical night includes a scenic drive into the wilderness, a campfire, hot drinks and Lappish snacks while you wait, and short walks to suitable viewing spots. The tours are designed to be low in physical difficulty for most guests, although the total time outside can range from a few hours up to a long night depending on conditions. When the aurora appears, we typically spend time outside for viewing and photos, but you can warm up in the vehicle during waiting periods.",

First, you are picked up from your hotel in Rovaniemi; the team will contact you with the exact pickup time based on the weather, usually between 16:00 and 22:00. Second, you take a scenic drive into the wilderness while the guide uses live aurora data and weather maps to select the best possible viewing spot. Third, you wait for the aurora: a small campfire is made, you enjoy Lappish snacks and hot drinks and can stay warm in the vehicle. Fourth, when the lights appear, your guide helps you enjoy the show and takes photos of you under the aurora. Finally, you are driven back to Rovaniemi; depending on the conditions, this might be after around 2 hours or after a much longer chase.",
